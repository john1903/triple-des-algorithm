# TripleDES

Author: John Gluzniewicz

## Description

This is a Java repository that contains an implementation of the Triple Data Encryption Standard (DES) algorithm, along with unit tests and a sample JavaFX project demonstrating its usage.

Triple DES, also known as TDES or TDEA, is a symmetric-key block cipher that applies the DES algorithm three times to each data block for enhanced security.

## Features

- Triple DES implementation in Java for encryption and decryption.
- Unit tests ensuring the correctness and robustness of the algorithm.
- Sample JavaFX project showcasing the integration of Triple DES encryption and decryption into a graphical user interface for file manipulation.

## How to Use

1. **Create a Blank Text File**: Start by creating an empty text file in your desired location.

2. **Generate Keys**:
   - Click on the "Enter key file path" text field or drag and drop your key file into the field.
   - Click the "Generate Keys" button to create encryption and decryption keys.

3. **Encrypt File**:
   - Similarly, select the file you want to encrypt by clicking on the "Enter file path" text field or dragging and dropping the file into the field.
   - Click the "Encrypt File" button to encrypt the selected file.
   - After a while, a new encrypted file will be created in the same location as the original file with the suffix "encrypted".

4. **Decrypt File**:
   - Select the encrypted file either by entering its path in the "Enter file path" text field or by dragging and dropping it.
   - Click the "Decrypt File" button to decrypt the selected file.
   - After a while, a new decrypted file will be created in the original location with the suffix "decrypted".

Follow these steps to securely encrypt and decrypt your files using the Triple DES algorithm implemented in this Java program.
