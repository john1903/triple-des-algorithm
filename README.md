# TripleDES

Author: John Gluzniewicz

## Description

Java-TripleDES is a Java repository that contains an implementation of the Triple Data Encryption Standard (DES) algorithm, along with unit tests and a sample JavaFX project demonstrating its usage.

Triple DES, also known as TDES or TDEA, is a symmetric-key block cipher that applies the DES algorithm three times to each data block for enhanced security.

## Features

- Triple DES implementation in Java for encryption and decryption.
- Unit tests ensuring the correctness and robustness of the algorithm.
- Sample JavaFX project showcasing the integration of Triple DES encryption and decryption into a graphical user interface for file manipulation.
